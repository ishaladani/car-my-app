# EmailJS Setup Guide

## How to Fix the "Public Key is invalid" Error

The error you're seeing occurs because EmailJS is not properly configured with your actual credentials. Follow these steps to fix it:

### Step 1: Get Your EmailJS Credentials

1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account)
2. Sign in to your EmailJS account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. From the dashboard, you'll need to get:
   - **Public Key** (found in Account > API Keys)
   - **Service ID** (found in Email Services)
   - **Template ID** (found in Email Templates)

### Step 2: Update the Configuration

Open the file `src/config/emailjs.js` and replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
export const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
  PUBLIC_KEY: 'your_actual_public_key_here',     // Replace this
  SERVICE_ID: 'your_actual_service_id_here',     // Replace this  
  TEMPLATE_ID: 'your_actual_template_id_here'    // Replace this
};
```

### Step 3: Create EmailJS Service

1. In EmailJS Dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Add a new service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Note down the Service ID

### Step 4: Create Email Template

1. In EmailJS Dashboard, go to "Email Templates"
2. Create a new template with these variables:
   - `{{to_email}}` - recipient email address
   - `{{subject}}` - email subject line
   - `{{message}}` - email message body
   - `{{invoice_number}}` - invoice number
   - `{{customer_name}}` - customer name
   - `{{total_amount}}` - total invoice amount
   - `{{garage_name}}` - garage/service provider name
   - `{{attachment}}` - PDF attachment (base64 encoded)
   - `{{attachment_name}}` - PDF filename
3. Note down the Template ID

### Step 5: Test the Email Function

After updating the credentials, restart your development server and test the email functionality.

## Example Email Template

Here's an example of what your EmailJS template might look like:

```html
Subject: {{subject}}

Dear {{customer_name}},

{{message}}

Invoice Details:
- Invoice Number: {{invoice_number}}
- Total Amount: â‚¹{{total_amount}}
- Service Provider: {{garage_name}}

Please find your professional invoice attached as a PDF document.

Best regards,
{{garage_name}} Team

[PDF attachment: {{attachment_name}} will be automatically included]
```

### Important Notes for PDF Attachments:

1. **EmailJS Template Settings**: In your EmailJS template, make sure to:
   - Set the attachment field to use `{{attachment}}`
   - Set the attachment filename to use `{{attachment_name}}`
   - Configure the attachment type as "application/pdf"

2. **Template Variables**: The system automatically provides these variables:
   - `{{attachment}}` - Base64 encoded PDF data
   - `{{attachment_name}}` - Formatted filename like "Invoice_INV001.pdf"
   - All other variables are populated from the invoice data

3. **File Size Limits**: EmailJS has attachment size limits. For large invoices, consider:
   - Optimizing the PDF generation
   - Using a cloud storage service for very large files

## Troubleshooting

- **"Public Key is invalid"**: Make sure you've copied the correct public key from your EmailJS dashboard
- **"Service ID not found"**: Verify your service ID in the Email Services section
- **"Template ID not found"**: Check your template ID in the Email Templates section
- **Email not sending**: Ensure your email service (Gmail, etc.) is properly configured

## Security Note

Never commit your actual EmailJS credentials to version control. Consider using environment variables for production deployments.
